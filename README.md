# Optimize me

A React application **intentionally** coded to have **performance issues**.

There are three main sections:

- A form;
- A table with basic filters and an interactive cell;
- A list of images that can be edited within a dialog.

Each section has problems that slow down performance when typing and interacting with the UI.

This app can be optimized in different ways; the `solution` branch contains one of the possible optimized versions.
